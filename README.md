Domain Finder

The Domain Finder is a Python script designed to perform bulk domain searches for companies, colleges, industries, and other entities using the Google search engine.

Libraries utilized in this script include Beautiful Soup, Requests, and Openpyxl.

The process is as follows: Upon running the code, a list of keywords (representing companies, colleges, etc.) is fetched from the input file. The script then uses the Google search engine to retrieve the domain of the first result and stores it in a separate Excel sheet within the same workbook
